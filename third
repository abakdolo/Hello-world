Count the number of times that each element occurs in the list named pantry that appears in the code block below. You'll need to:

Create an empty dictionary named pantry_counts.
Loop through each item in pantry.
If the item appears in pantry_counts, add 1 to the value in pantry_counts for the item's key.
Otherwise, add the item to pantry_counts as a key, with the value 1.
When finished, each item in pantry will have its own key in pantry_counts, and its value will be the number of times the item appears in pantry.

pantry = ["apple", "orange", "grape", "apple", "orange", "apple", "tomato", "potato", "grape"]
pantry_counts = {}
for item in pantry:
    if item in pantry_counts:
        pantry_counts[item] = pantry_counts[item] + 1
    else:
        pantry_counts[item] = 1
print(pantry_counts)

Count how many times each type of weather occurs in the weather list, 
and store the results in a new dictionary called weather_counts.
When finished, weather_counts should contain a key for each different type of weather in the weather list, 
along with its associated frequency. Here's a preview of how the result should format the weather_counts dictionary 
(note that you'll be using real values, rather than the dummy ones below):

weather_counts = {}
for item in weather:
    if item in weather_counts:
        weather_counts[item] = weather_counts[item] + 1
    else:
        weather_counts[item] = 1
print(weather_counts)
